<li>The company has a head office in Delhi and regional offices throughout India.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business Issue</h3>
<h6>The sales director is facing a lot of challenges such as:</h6>
<p>The marketing is growing dynamically and then he’s struggling in terms of tracking the sales, needing more accurate insights about the company sales, and then take the necessary decisions.</p>
<h6>Imagine the scenario:</h6>
<p>The sales director need to know how the sales are going in all operations and the information provided by the regional sales managers are not being enough.<br>Just hearing the numbers or receive tons of excel files is far from being effective in terms of having a reliable overview of the business.<br>Instead, he want to be able to look at the data and understand what’s going on right away.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Create a simple and informative dashboard about the company sales.</p>
<h3>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)</h3>
<p>Once I know the basic features of the data I have to work with, I imported the MySQL database into Power BI.</p>
<h3>Data Transformation in Power BI</h3>
<p>Once the data is imported in Power BI, we do ‘transform data’ i.e. using Power Query editor to perform certain operation on to the data. Ensuring correct data types, creating custom/conditional columns are some fundamental task performed in Power Query.</p>
<h3>Modeling Schema in Power BI</h3>
<p>Created 'one to many' relationship model between dimension table and fact table using primary key and foreign key concept.</p>
<h3>Created Measures</h3>
<p>Created required measures using aggregation, filter DAX functions.</p>
<h3>Creating a Report in Power BI</h3>
<p>A report is created in Power BI with various charts depicting Revenue by Market, Sales Quantity by Market, Revenue Trend, Top 5 Customers by Revenue, Top 5 Customers by Quantity, Revenue by Zone, Sales Quantity by Zone and KPI such as Total Revenue & Total Sales Quantity. All these charts can be filtered using Year and Months slicer.</p>
<h3>Deployment in Power BI</h3>
<p>In Power BI, You can directly publish the report online to your workstation. If you do not have the work email-id then you can save the file in ‘.pbix’ version. This helps another viewer see your work and understand the story or insights you’re communicating.</p>

<p>Based on the dashboards insights, I have made some conclusions and recommendation that Sales Marketing team should/can consider making a sales strategy.</p>
